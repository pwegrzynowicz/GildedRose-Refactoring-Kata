# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a
prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named
Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our
goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by
date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was
developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new
adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we
can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our
system:

- All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have
to sell the item
- All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
- The Quality of an item is never negative
- "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
- The Quality of an item is never more than 50
- "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases
in Quality
- "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as it's SellIn
value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less
and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the
concert

We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an
update to our system:

- "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any
new code as long as everything still works correctly. However, do not
alter the Item class or Items property as those belong to the goblin
in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn't
believe in shared code ownership (you can make the UpdateQuality
method and Items property static if you like, we'll cover for you).

Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase
above 50, however "Sulfuras" is a legendary item and as such its
Quality is 80 and it never alters.

## Getting Started

run-once.sh runs your tests once

Before this will work you will need:
  - make and a C++ compiler (like gcc) is installed on your system and is in the PATH
  - The GTest framework in the directory gtest.
  - If your IDE does the compilation and linking, you should remove the first 3 lines
    in the run-once.sh file.

More Verbose Instructions
-------------------------

Create a clone of both GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata and googletest in a directory we'll call ${ROOT_INSTALL_DIR}:

    cd ${ROOT_INSTALL_DIR}
    git clone https://github.com/pwegrzynowicz/gildedrose-refactoring-kata
    git clone https://github.com/google/googletest

Make googletest by running make in subfolder googletest/googletest/make:

    cd googletest/googletest/make
    make

Create a softlink in the GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata clone pointing at the googletest code:

    cd ${ROOT_INSTALL_DIR}/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/cpp
    ln -s ${ROOT_INSTALL_DIR}/googletest/googletest gtest

Make the GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata:

    make

Then you should be able to run the tests:

    ./run_once.sh

If you have been successful, then you should see a failing test, "GildedRoseTest.Foo".
